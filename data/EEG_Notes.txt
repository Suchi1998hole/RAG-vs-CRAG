EEG (Electroencephalography) - 100 Line Notes
=============================================================
1. EEG stands for Electroencephalography.
2. It records electrical activity of the brain through scalp electrodes.
3. The first EEG was recorded by Hans Berger in 1924.
4. EEG measures voltage fluctuations from ionic currents within neurons.
5. EEG provides excellent temporal resolution (~1 ms).
6. The amplitude of EEG signals is usually between 10–100 µV.
7. EEG frequency range: 0.5–100 Hz.
8. EEG reflects summed post-synaptic potentials.
9. EEG is widely used in neuroscience and clinical diagnostics.
10. EEG is non-invasive and safe.
